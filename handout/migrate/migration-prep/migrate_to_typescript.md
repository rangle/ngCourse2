# Migrate to TypeScript

TypeScript is a superset of ES6 and, as its name suggests, uses a type system.
This can have an enormous impact on developer tools, providing richer
auto-complete and static analysis.

Angular 2 was built using TypeScript, and supports decorators which provide meta 
information to Angular.  While it is possible to use Angular 2 without these 
features, the syntax feels more "natural" with TypeScript's decorators.
