# Review of Reducers and Pure Functions

One of the core concepts of Redux is the *reducer*. A reducer is a function with
the signature `(accumulator: T, item: U) => T`. Reducers are often used in 
JavaScript through the `Array.reduce` method, which iterates over each of the 
array's items and accumulates a single value as a result. Reducers should be 
*pure functions*, meaning they don't generate any side-effects.

A simple example of a reducer is the sum function:

```javascript
let x = [1, 2, 3].reduce((sum, number) => sum + number, 0);
// x == 6 
```
