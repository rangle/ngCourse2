# Training Workshop

Over the last few days, we have had a number of stand-alone exercises to demonstrate some of the core ideas of Angular 2. Now, we will be spending a day to build out a TodoMVC style application using Angular 2 and Redux.

The workshop is broken down into a few breakpoints. There will be time allowed to complete the tasks at each stage. However, if you are unable to complete everything required - you will be able to pull down a branch with the previous work shop work completed.
