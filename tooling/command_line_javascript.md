# Command Line JavaScript: NodeJS

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows JavaScript code to run outside of a browser using Google V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js is used for writting fast executing code on the server to handle events and non-blocking I/O efficently.

* REPL \(Read-Eval-Print-Loop\) to quickly write and test JavaScript code.
* The V8 JavaScript interpreter.
* Modules for doing OS tasks like file I/O, HTTP, etc.

While Node.js was initially intended for writing server code in JavaScript, today it is widely used by JavaScript tools, which makes it relevant to front-end programmers too. A lot of the tools you'll be using in this course leverage Node.js.
