# Observables Array Operations
In addition to simply iterating over an asynchronous collection, we can perform other operations such as filter or map and many more as defined in the RxJS API. This is what bridges an `Observable` with the iterable pattern, and lets us conceptualize them as collections.

Let's expand our example and do something a little more with our stream:

```js
export class App {
  private doctors = [];
  
  constructor(http: Http) {
    http.get('http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/')
        .flatMap((response) => response.json())
        .filter((person) => person.id > 5)
        .map((person) => "Dr. " + person.name)
        .subscribe((data) => {
          this.doctors.push(data);
        });
  }
}
```

Here are two really useful array operations - `map` and `filter`. What exactly do these do?

* `map` will create a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in this array. In this example we used it to create a new result set by iterating through each item and appending the "Dr." abbreviation in front of every user's name. Now every object in our array has "Dr." prepended to the value of its name property. 

* `filter` will create a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by a provided function. Here we have used it to create a new result set by excluding any user whose `id` property is less than six. 

Now when our `subscribe` callback gets invoked, the data it receives will be a list of JSON objects whose `id` properties are greater than or equal to six and whose `name` properties have been prepended with `Dr. `. 

Note the chaining function style, and the optional static typing that comes with TypeScript, that we used in this example. Most importantly functions like `filter` return an `Observable`, as in `Observables` beget other `Observables`, similarly to promises. In order to use `map` and `filter` in a chaining sequence we have flattened the results of our `Observable` using `flatMap`. Since `filter` accepts an `Observable`, and not an array, we have to convert our array of JSON objects from `data.json()` to an `Observable` stream. This is done with `flatMap`.

There are many other array operations you can employ in your `Observables`; look for them in the [RxJS API](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS).
