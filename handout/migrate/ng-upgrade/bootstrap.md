# Bootstrapping ng-upgrade

- Use manual Angular 1.x bootstrapping, and remove `ng-app`/`ng-strict-di`
references if they exist
- Add Angular 2 dependencies
- Add the upgrade adapter `import {UpgradeAdapter} from '@angular/upgrade'`
- Call the upgrade adapter's bootstrap

Once this is working the foundation is set for transitioning from Angular 1.x to
Angular 2.  It is important to note that the upgrade adapter's bootstrap
mechanism is asynchronous. Additionally it's important to treat the upgrade
adapter as a singleton.

The following file creates an instance of `UpgradeAdapter` and exports it.

```js
// Angular 2 Vendor Import
import {UpgradeAdapter} from '@angular/upgrade';
import {NgModule, forwardRef} from '@angular/core';
import {BrowserModule} from '@angular/platform-browser';

// Instantiate an adapter with the AppModule
// Use forwardRef to pass AppModule reference at runtime
export const upgradeAdapter = new UpgradeAdapter(forwardRef(() => AppModule));

@NgModule({
  declarations: [],
  providers: [],
  imports: [BrowserModule]
})
export class AppModule {
}
```

The following file bootstraps an Angular 1/2 hybrid application:

```js
// Import the upgradeAdapter singleton
import {upgradeAdapter} from './upgrade-adapter';

// Name the application
const APPNAME = 'angular-upgrade-example';

// Register classic Angular 1 modules
angular.module(APPNAME, []);

// Bootstrap Angular 2 - *note* this is asynchronous
upgradeAdapter.bootstrap(document.body, [APPNAME], {strictDi: true});
```

The above example does not actually do anything other than bootstrap an empty application.

## Upgrading/Downgrading Components

Once bootstrapping is complete, Angular 1.x components can be _upgraded_ to
work with Angular 2.  Conversely, Angular 2 components can be _downgraded_ to
work with Angular 1.x.
