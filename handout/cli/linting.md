# Linting

To encourage coding best practices Angular CLI provides built-in linting. By default the app will look at the project's `tslint.json` for configuration. Linting can be executed by running the command `ng lint`.

For a reference of tslint rules have a look at: https://palantir.github.io/tslint/rules/.
