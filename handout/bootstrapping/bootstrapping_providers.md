# Bootstrapping Providers

The bootstrap process also starts the dependency injection system in Angular 2.
We won't go over Angular 2's dependency injection system here - that is covered later.
Instead let's take a look at an example of how to bootstrap your application with application-wide providers.

For this, we will register a service called `Greeter` with the `providers` property of the module we are using to bootstrap the application.

_*app/app.module.ts*_
```js
import { BrowserModule }  from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { NgModule } '@angular/core';
import { MyApp } from './app.component'
import { Greeter } from './greeter.service';

@NgModule({
  imports: [BrowserModule],
  providers: [Greeter],
  declarations: [MyApp],
  bootstrap: [MyApp]
})
export class MyAppModule {

}
```
