# FormBuilder Basics

To begin with FormBuilder, we must first ensure we are working with the right directives and the right classes in order to take advantage of procedural forms. For this, we need to ensure that the `FormsModule` and `ReactiveFormsModule` was imported in the bootstrap phase of the application module.

This will give us access to components, directives and providers like `FormBuilder`, `FormGroup`, and `FormControl`

In our case, to build a login form, we're looking at something like the following:

_app/login-form.component.ts_
```ts
import {Component} from '@angular/core';
import {
  FormBuilder,
  FormControl
} from '@angular/forms';

@Component({
  selector: 'login-form',
  templateUrl: 'app/login-form.component.html',
})
export class LoginForm {
  loginForm: FormGroup;
  username: FormControl;
  password: FormControl;

  constructor (builder: FormBuilder) {
    this.username = new FormControl('', []);
    this.password = new FormControl('', []);
    this.loginForm = builder.group({
      username: this.username,
      password: this.password
    });
  }

  login () {
    console.log(this.loginForm.value);
    // Attempt Logging in...
  }
}
```

_app/login-form.component.html_
```html
<form [formGroup]="loginForm" (ngSubmit)="login()">
  <label for="username">username</label>
  <input type="text" name="username" id="username" [formControl]="username">

  <label for="password">password</label>
  <input type="password" name="password" id="password" [formControl]="password">

  <button type="submit">log in</button>
</form>
```

### `FormControl`
Note that the `FormControl` class is assigned to similarly named fields, both on `this` and in the `FormBuilder#group({ })` method.
This is mostly for ease of access.
By saving references to the `FormControl` instances on `this`, you can access the inputs in the template without having to reference the form itself.
The form fields can otherwise be reached in the template by using `loginForm.controls.username` and `loginForm.controls.password`.
Likewise, any instance of `FormControl` in this situation can access its parent group by using its `.root` property (e.g. `username.root.controls.password`).
> Make sure that `root` and `controls` exist before they're used.

A `FormControl` requires two properties: an initial value and a list of validators.
Right now, we have no validation. This will be added in the next steps.
