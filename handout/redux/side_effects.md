# Side Effects

Often times, we need to perform some logic after an action has been dispatched 
and the store has been updated. Because reducers should be side-effect free, we 
need a way to handle these side-effects. Sometimes we can put this logic with 
our action creator services, and that works for simple cases, but often times 
the same block of logic needs to run in response to multiple action types.

[@ngrx](https://github.com/ngrx) offers a library called 
[@ngrx/effects](https://github.com/ngrx/effects) to solve these problems.

## Creating your first effects service

Let's say we have an application that supports customizable themes and other 
customization options. To support this functionality, we'll need to fetch these 
customizations from the server whenever a user logs into the application.

Let's build out a `CustomizationEffects` service to accomplish this:

```typescript
import {Injectable} from '@angular/core';
import {Action} from '@ngrx/store';
import {Actions, Effect} from '@ngrx/effects';
import {Observable} from 'rxjs/Observable';

import {createAction} from '../createAction';
import {CustomizationActions, SessionActions} from '../session/session.actions.ts';
import {ApiService} from '../../services';

@Injectable()
export class CustomizationEffects {

  constructor(
    private actions$: Actions,
    private apiService: ApiService
  ) {
    
  }

  @Effect()
  login$ = this.actions$
    .ofType(SessionActions.LOGIN_SEND_SUCCESS)
    .mergeMap<Action>(action => this.apiService.getCustomizations(action.payload.userId)
      .map(result => createAction(CustomizationActions.CUSTOMIZATIONS_RETRIEVE_SUCCESS, result.json()))
      .catch(error => Observable.of(createAction(CustomizationActions.CUSTOMIZATIONS_RETRIEVE_ERROR, error.json())))
    );
  
}
```

[@ngrx/effects](https://github.com/ngrx/effects) provides an Angular `actions$` 
service (which is also an `Observable`) to emit every action that has been 
dispatched by your application in a single stream. Its `ofType()` method can be 
used to filter the one or more actions we're interesting in before adding a 
side-effect.

In this example, when the `LOGIN_SEND_SUCCESS` action occurs from anywhere in 
the application, we make a request to the server to fetch the user's 
customizations given their `userId`, which has been attached to the payload of 
this action. Regardless if this requests succeeds or fails, we need to create 
and return an `Observable` that is bound to the new action we'd like Redux to 
perform, such as storing the customizations when the request is successful, or 
processing the error returned by the server if there's an error.

To tell [@ngrx/effects](https://github.com/ngrx/effects) which `Observable` 
objects are side-effects to associate them with Redux, we need to provide a hint
using the `@Effect()` decorator. Without it, your side-effect will not run.

## Configuring your effects service

Lastly, we just need to add the `CustomizationEffects` service as a module to 
the `@NgModule`'s imports to start the effects:

```typescript
// ...
import {EffectsModule} from '@ngrx/effects';

import {CustomizationEffects} from './store/customization/customization.effects';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    // ...
    EffectsModule.run(CustomizationEffects)
  ],
  // ...
})
export class AppModule { }
```
