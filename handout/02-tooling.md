# Part 2: The JavaScript Toolchain

In this section, we'll describe the tools that you'll be using for the rest of the course.

## Source Control: [Git](http://git-scm.com/)

`git` is a distributed versioning system for source code.  It allows developers to collaborate on the same codebase without stepping on each other's toes.  It has become the de-facto source control system for open source development because of it's decentralized model and cheap branching features.

## The Command Line

JavaScript development tools are very command-line oriented.  If you come from a Windows background you may find this unfamiliar.  However the command-line provides better support for automating development tasks, so it's worth getting comfortable with it.

We will provide examples for all command-line activities required by this course.

## Command-line JavaScript: [Node.JS](http://nodejs.org)

NodeJS is an environment that lets you write JavaScript programs that live outside the browser.  It provides:

* the V8 JavaScript interpreter
* modules for doing OS tasks like file I/O, HTTP, etc.

While NodeJS was initially intended for writing server code in JavaScript, today it is widely used by JavaScript tools, which makes it relevant to front-end developers too. A lot of the tools you'll be using in this code leverage NodeJS.

## Back-End Code Sharing and Distribution: [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

`npm` is the "node package manager".  It installs with NodeJS, and gives you access to a wide variety of 3rd-party JavaScript modules.

It also does dependency management for your back-end application.  You specify module dependencies in a file called `package.json`; running `npm install` will resolve, download and install your back-end application's dependencies.

## Module Loading, Bundling and Build Tasks: [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/docs/what-is-webpack.html)

Webpack takes modules with dependencies and generates static assets representing those modules. It can bundle JavaScript, CSS, HTML or just about anything via additional loaders. Webpack can also be extended via plugins, for example minification and mangling can be done using the UglifyJS plugin for webpack.

## Chrome

Chrome is the web browser from Google.  We will be using it for this course because of it's cutting-edge JavaScript engine and excellent debugging tools.

Code written with AngularJS should work on any modern web browser however (Firefox, IE9+, Chrome, Safari).

## Getting the Code

Before you proceed, get the code from Git if you have not done so:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/rangle/ngcourse2.git
  cd ngcourse2
```

Now, switch to the branch that you'll be using for today's course:

```bash
  git branch --track YYYY-DD-MM origin/YYYY-DD-MM
  git checkout YYYY-DD-MM
```

**Replace "YYYY-DD-MM" above with the start date of the course, e.g., "2015-06-17".**

This gives you a hollowed-out version of the application we'll be building.

Install NPM and Bower packages:

```
  npm install
```

Start webpack's development server

```
  npm start
```

You can also serve the app from a build directory using something like `http-server`.

Install it if you have not yet done so:

```
  npm install -g http-server
```

```
  http-server app/__build
```
