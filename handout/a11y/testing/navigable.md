# Is my Application Navigable?
One of the key accessibility features for any application is keyboard navigability. Because many forms of [assistive technology](screen-readers.md) rely on keyboard controls exclusively, testing for keyboard support is a good thing to prioritize. Check in particular:

- Can basic tasks and workflows be completed using only a keyboard?
- Can all forms be completed using only a keyboard?
- When an element has tab focus, is there a visual indicator?
- If a modal or overlay opens, is keyboard focus trapped inside the new context until it is closed?
