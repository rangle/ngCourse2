# Replacing Services with TypeScript Classes

Early Angular 1 applications predate the widespread use of module loaders.
The strategy of this era was to concatenate source files and rely on Angular 1's
dependency injection as a poor-man's module loader. Often services were used to
house _libraries_ instead of _stateful services_.

During conversion, we will introduce Webpack as a module loader. For services
that lack state and don't heavily rely on other dependency injected services,
we recommend rewriting them using TypeScript modules. The advantages of writing
code this way are:

* It becomes framework agnostic (doesn't rely on Angular 1 explicitly)
* It is easier to test
* It instantly works with both Angular 1 and Angular 2

Even services that depend on a limited set of Angular 1 services (e.g. `$http`)
can be rewritten by depending on other libraries (e.g. `window.fetch`).

## How do we get there?

* Convert services using `.factory` to `.service`
  * Angular 2's `@Injectable` expects an object it can use `new` with,
  similar to how `.service` works (e.g. `new CalculatorService()`)
* Replace constructor functions with TypeScript `class`
* Use the class directly by `export`ing it.


## Example

### `.factory` original
```js
angular.module('calcapp', [])
  .factory('CalculatorService', function () {
    return {
      square: function (a) {
        return a*a;
      },
      cube: function (a) {
        return a*a*a;
      }
    };
  });
```

### Conversion to `.service`
```js
angular.module('calcapp', [])
  .service('CalculatorService', function () {
    this.square = function (a) {
      return a*a;
    };

    this.cube = function (a) {
      return a*a*a;
    }
  });
```

### Conversion to TypeScript class
```js
class CalculatorService {
  square (a) {
    return a*a;
  }

  cube (a) {
    return a*a*a;
  }
}

angular.module('calcapp', [])
  .service('CalculatorService', CalculatorService);
```

### Skip the middleman
```js
export class CalculatorService { ... }

// elsewhere
import {CalculatorService} from './calculator.service';
```
