# Actions

Redux uses a concept called Actions, which describe state changes to your 
application. Redux actions are simple JSON objects that implement the `Action` 
interface provided by [@ngrx](https://github.com/ngrx):

```typescript
export interface Action {
  type: string;
  payload?: any;
}
```

The `type` property is a string used to uniquely identify your action to your 
application. It's a common convention to use *lisp-case* (such as `MY_ACTION`),
however you are free to use whatever casing style that makes to your team, as 
long as it's consistent across the project.

The `payload` property provides a way to pass additional data to other parts of 
Redux, and it's entirely optional.

Here is an example:

```typescript
const loginSendAction: Action = {
  type: 'LOGIN_SEND',
  payload: {
    username: 'katie',
    password: '35c0cd1ecbbb68c75498b83c4e79fe2b'
  }
};
```

> Plain objects are used so that the actions are serializable and can be 
replayable into the application state. Even if your actions involve asynchronous 
logic, the final dispatched action will remain a plain JSON object.

To simplify action creation, you can create a factory function to take care of
the repeating parts within your application:

_app/store/createAction.ts_
```typescript
import {Action} from '@ngrx/store';

export function createAction(type, payload?): Action {
  return { type, payload };
}
```

The resulting creation of the `LOGIN_SEND` action becomes much more succinct and 
cleaner:

```typescript
const loginSendAction: Action = createAction('LOGIN_SEND', {
  username: 'katie',
  password: '35c0cd1ecbbb68c75498b83c4e79fe2b'
});
```
