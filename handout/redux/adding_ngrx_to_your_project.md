# Adding Ngrx to your Project

In your console, run the following command to add 
[ngrx](https://github.com/ngrx) to your list of dependencies in `package.json`:

```shell
npm install @ngrx/core @ngrx/store --save
```

If you plan on using the [ngrx-effects](https://github.com/ngrx/effects) 
extensions to add side-effect capabilities, then also run the following command:

```shell
npm install @ngrx/effects --save
```
