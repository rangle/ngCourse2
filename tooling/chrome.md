# Chrome

We use Google's Chrome browser for this course because of its cutting-edge JavaScript engine and excellent debugging tools.

However you are free to use other browsers. Not well known, there is a Mozilla Firefox [Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/) available with support for great development and debugging tools. Code written with JavaScript should work on any modern web browser \(Firefox, IE9+, Chrome, Safari, Opera\).
