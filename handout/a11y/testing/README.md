# Testing for Accessibility
Automated accessibility checkers can help you find problems with your application, but they can also produce noisy, overwhelming results that may not surface the most important issues affecting the usability of your app. It's therefore important to know how to test for accessibility yourself.

There are many different concerns to consider when testing your application for accessibility. The following questions can guide your accessibility testing and provide concrete items for evaluation:

- [Is my Application Readable?](readable.md)
- [Is my Application Predictable?](predictable.md)
- [Is my Application Navigable?](navigable.md)

One excellent method for covering the bases of an accessible application is to [test with screen readers](screen-readers.md).
