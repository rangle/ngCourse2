## The Code

The repository also contains a sample app. The project has a server and client component. This repository contains only the *client* code. The server code is available at [github.com/rangle/ngcourse-api](https://github.com/rangle/ngcourse-api). However, You do **not** need the server code to run the front end. Instead, you can access the API server deployed to [ngcourse.herokuapp.com/](http://ngcourse.herokuapp.com) and develop the client-side code on your own machine.

To run the sample app:

1. Install dependencies and typings:

    ```bash
    cd app
    npm install
    ```

2. Start the build process and the development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

3. Then point your browser to <http://localhost:3000>
