# 1.1 - Basic Routing with Paramaters

* Add a route that takes an `:id` paramater to load the `UserDetails` component in _*app/routes/app.routes.ts*_
* Modify `UsersList` component so the user names become links to the user detail, using the `id` on the user object.
* Modify the `UserDetail` component to use the `ActivatedRoute` service to load the correct user details
