# 1.0 - Basic Routing

This series of exercises will walk you through configuring basic routing for an application. Most of the components have already been built out, and the areas that require completion are:

* `@RouteConfig` in _*app/container/app.ts*_
* Use correct `routerLink` to provide links to Home, Users List and Company List
* Setup a default route for the `Home` component
