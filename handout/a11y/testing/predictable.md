# Is my Application Predictable?
Users should be able to reasonably anticipate how an application behaves, and they should remain in control of their experience at all times. Check for the following:

- Has auto-play been turned off on all sliders, video and audio? Are playback controls available?
- Will the user be warned if a context switch occurs (e.g. a new window opening)?
- Can interruptions (such as alerts or page updates) be postponed or suppressed by the user?
- Does the user have enough time to read alerts? Does the user's screen reader have enough time?
