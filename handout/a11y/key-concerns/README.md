# Key Concerns of Accessible Web Applications

It's best to focus on the following three areas when making a web application accessible:

- [Semantic Markup](semantic-markup.md) - Allows the application to be understood on a more general level rather than just details of whats being rendered
- [Keyboard Accessibility](keyboard-accessibility.md) - Applications must still be usable when using only a keyboard
- [Visual Assistance](visual-assistance.md) - color contrast, focus of elements and text representations of audio and events
