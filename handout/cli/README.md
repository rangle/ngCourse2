# Angular CLI

With all of the new features Angular takes advantage of, like static typing, decorators and ES6 module resolution, comes the added cost of setup and maintenance. Spending a lot of time with different build setups and configuring all of the different tools used to serve a modern JavaScript application can really take a lot of time and drain productivity by not being able to actually work on the app itself.

Seeing the popularity of [ember-cli](http://www.ember-cli.com/), Angular decided they would provide their own CLI to solve this problem. [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) is geared to be the tool used to create and manage your Angular app. It provides the ability to:

- create a project from scratch
- scaffold components, directives, services, etc.
- lint your code
- serve the application
- run your unit tests and end to end tests.

> The Angular CLI currently only generates scaffolding in TypeScript, with other dialects to come later.
