# Back-End Code Sharing and Distribution: [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

`npm` is the "node package manager".  It installs with NodeJS, and gives you access to a wide variety of 3rd-party JavaScript modules.

It also performs dependency management for your back-end application.  You specify module dependencies in a file called `package.json`; running `npm install` will resolve, download and install your back-end application's dependencies.
