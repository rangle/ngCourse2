# Using ng-metadata (Angular 1.x Using >= 2 Style)

The ng-metadata approach is done with Angular 1.x dependencies and a few small
helper libraries.  ng-metadata allows developers to use Angular 2 style
TypeScript (annotations/decorators) _without_ Angular 2.  Unfortunately
templates are still mostly in Angular 1.x style.

Once an application is converted to ng-metadata style it is very close to Angular
2, but still requires refactoring.  In most cases, ng-metadata is not as efficient
as ng-upgrade with respect to refactoring time.  The payload of an
ng-metadata application is smaller, and porting to ng-metadata can be done in an
even more ad-hoc fashion than with ng-upgrade.

The general flow of using ng-metadata with an application is:

- Install ng-metadata dependencies
- Bootstrap root component
- Upgrade components strategically
- Refactor the codebase to Angular 2

ng-metadata is favored over the deprecated ng-forward.
