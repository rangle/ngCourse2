# Combining Streams with `flatMap`

A case for FlatMap:

- [A simple observable stream](http://jsbin.com/nutegi/36/edit?js,console)
- [A stream of arrays](http://jsbin.com/lerake/3/edit?js,console)
- [Filter the items from each event](http://jsbin.com/widadiz/2/edit?js,console)
- [Stream of filtered items](http://jsbin.com/reyoja/2/edit?js,console)
- [Filter + map simplified with flatMap](http://jsbin.com/sahiye/2/edit?js,console)


Let's say we wanted to implement an AJAX search feature in which every keypress in a text field will automatically perform a search and update the page with the results. How would this look? Well we would have an `Observable` subscribed to events coming from an input field, and on every change of input we want to perform some HTTP request, which is also an `Observable` we subscribe to. What we end up with is an `Observable` of an `Observable`.

By using `flatMap` we can transform our event stream (the keypress events on the text field) into our response stream (the search results from the HTTP request).

_*app/services/search.service.ts*_

```js
import {Http} from '@angular/http';
import {Injectable} from '@angular/core';

@Injectable()
export class SearchService {

  constructor(private http: Http) {}

  search(term: string) {
    return this.http
    		.get('https://api.spotify.com/v1/search?q=' + term + '&type=artist')
    		.map((response) => response.json())
  }
}
```

Here we have a basic service that will undergo a search query to Spotify by performing a get request with a supplied search term. This `search` function returns an `Observable` that has had some basic post-processing done (turning the response into a JSON object).

OK, let's take a look at the component that will be using this service.

_*app/app.component.ts*_

```js
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { FormControl,
	FormGroup,
	FormBuilder } from '@angular/forms';
import { SearchService } from './services/search.service';
import 'rxjs/Rx';

@Component({
	selector: 'app',
	template: `
		<form [formGroup]="coolForm"><input formControlName="search" placeholder="Search Spotify artist"></form>

		<div *ngFor="let artist of result">
		  {{artist.name}}
		</div>
	`
})

export class MyApp {
	searchField: FormControl;
	coolForm: FormGroup;

	constructor(private searchService:SearchService, private fb:FormBuilder) {
		this.searchField = new FormControl();
		this.coolForm = fb.group({search: this.searchField});

		this.searchField.valueChanges
		  .debounceTime(400)
			.flatMap(term => this.searchService.search(term))
			.subscribe((result) => {
				this.result = result.artists.items
			});
	}
}
```

Here we have set up a basic form with a single field, `search`, which we subscribe to for event changes.
We've also set up a simple binding for any results coming from the `SearchService`.
The real magic here is `flatMap` which allows us to flatten our two separate subscribed `Observables`
into a single cohesive stream we can use to control events coming from user input and from server responses.

Note that flatMap flattens a stream of `Observables` (i.e `Observable` of `Observables`) to a stream of emitted values (a simple `Observable`), by emitting on the "trunk" stream everything that will be emitted on "branch" streams.
