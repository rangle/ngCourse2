#  Upgrading Components Strategically 

Services that have no dependencies are excellent candidates for conversion. Once
converted to Angular 2, services can be downgraded to work in Angular 1.x.
Components can follow a similar strategy, with "leaf" components being converted
before "root" components.

Possibly the most challenging component/service to upgrade is Angular 1.x's UI
Router library.  This process _might_ be simplified in the future, but for
the moment it's best to upgrade UI Router last.
