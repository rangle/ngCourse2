# Part 5: Angular 2 Dependency Injection #

Dependency injection (DI) was a core feature in Angular 1.x, and that has not changed in Angular 2.  DI is a programming concept that predates Angular.  The purpose of DI is to simplify dependency management in software components. By reducing the amount of information a component needs to know about its dependencies, unit testing can be made easier, and code is more likely to be flexible.

Angular 2 improves on Angular 1.x's DI model by unifying Angular 1.x's two injection systems.  Tooling issues with respect to static analyis, and minification have also been fixed in Angular 2.  Namespace collisions have also been addressed in Angular 2.

## Simple Service Example

This example demonstrates injecting Angular's http service into a TypeScript class

```js
import {Injectable} from 'angular2/core';
// import the dependency for its _typings_
// *note* Http is _not_ used/instantiated in this module, it is injected
import {Http} from 'angular2/http';

@Injectable() // <- do not forget brackets after @Injectable!!
export class Dependent {
    constructor(public http:Http) {}
    someMethod() {
        this.http.get()
        ...
    }
}
```

Dependent is a simple TypeScript class that has been decorated with `@Injectable`.  This [decorator][pascalDIservice] is a shortcut for a more verbose `@Inject` syntax.  This decorator essentially tells Angular 2 that this class is going to be injected with dependencies.  Angular 1.x developers can
think of it like `/* @ngInject */`.

This example is also odd in that `Http` is imported even though it's going to be injected.  This import statement only pulls in the Http module from Angular 2. The Angular 2 injector is ultimately responsible for _instantiating_ `Http`, and _providing_ it to `Dependent`

## Simple Component Example

In this example we have a custom service:

```js
import {Injectable} from 'angular2/core';

@Injectable()
export class CustomService {
    getData() {
        return 'fancy data';
    }
}
```

Which is a dependency of a simple component:

```js
import {Component} from 'angular2/core';
import {CustomService} from './custom-service';

@Component({
    selector: 'simple-component',
    template: '<div>{{ output }}</div>',
    providers: [CustomService]
})
export class SimpleComponent {
    constructor(private customService: CustomService) {
        this.output = customService.getData();
    }
    output: string;
}
```

Using DI with components is the same as with plain services.  The important difference in this example is the `providers` array in the component decorator. The `providers` array is a mechanism for letting Angular 2's injector know about `CustomService`, and how to build it.  In this example `providers` was given only a class name, and Angular _inferred_ what to do with it.

## Using `providers` to Specify Alternate `CustomService`'s

The `providers` mechanism allows the programmer to specify mechanisms other than classes.  The above component example's `providers` array is really just a shorthand for:

```js
import {provide} from 'angular2/core';

...
providers: [provide(CustomService, {useClass: CustomService})]
...

```

The shorthand syntax eliminates a _lot_ of boilerplate.  The longhand syntax hints at the power of Angular 2's injector.

Instead of using a formal class in the previous example, it could be re-written to use an inline object.  (In the real world the formal class is likely the better option)

```js

import {Component} from 'angular2/core';
import {provide} from 'angular2/core';

var mockService = { getData: () => 'fancy data' };

@Component({
    selector: 'simple-component',
    template: '<div>{{ output }}</div>',
    providers: [provide(CustomService, { useValue: mockService })]
})
export class SimpleComponent {
    constructor(private customService: CustomService) {
        this.output = customService.getData();
    }
    output: string;
}
```

In this example Angular 2 knows that `CustomService` is a "value", and instead of instantiating under the hood (`new CustomService`), Angular 2 will simply return the value _provided_.

## Singletons

Angular 2 injectors (generally) return singletons.  That is, in the previous example, any _child_ components of `SimpleComponent` will receive the _same_ `CustomService` that `SimpleComponent` got.

## The Injector Tree

In Angular 2 there is not just one injector per application, there is _at least_ one injector per application.  Injectors are organized in a tree that parallels Angular 2's component tree.

The injector tree does _not_ make a new injector for every component.  The injector tree _does_ make a new injector for every component with a `providers` array in its decorator.  Components that have no `providers` array look to their parent component for an injector. If the parent does not have an injector, it looks up on, and on until it reaches the root injector.

_Warning:_ be careful with `provider` arrays.  If a child component is decorated with a `providers` array, and that array contains dependencies that were _also_ requested in the parent component(s) the dependencies the child receives will _shadow_ the parent dependencies.  This can have all sorts of negative consequences.
