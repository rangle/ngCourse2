# ng-upgrade (Angular 1.x Co-Existing With Angular 2)

The ng-upgrade is done by running Angular 2 and Angular 1 together in the same
application.  In this scenario Angular 1.x controls the page, and Angular 2
controls the change detection mechanisms.  Once the two Angulars co-exist,
upgrading can be done in strategic pieces.
