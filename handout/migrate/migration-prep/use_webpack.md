# Using Webpack

Using a module loader like webpack is essential for migrating to Angular, and
should already be part of every modern programmer's tool set.  Webpack will make
it easy to manage all the different files that a modern, modular Angular 1.3+
project prescribes.  This includes bundling the application for distribution or
deployment.

Using webpack will also simplify a programmer's Angular workflow, since the
easiest way to work with Angular is with TypeScript, or ES6, neither of which
works natively in contemporary browsers.
