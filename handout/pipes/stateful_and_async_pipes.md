# Stateful Pipes ##

There are two categories of pipes:

* _Stateless_ pipes are pure functions that flow input data through without remembering anything or causing detectable side-effects. Most pipes are stateless. The `CurrencyPipe` we used and the length pipe we created are examples of a stateless pipe.

* _Stateful_ pipes are those which can manage the state of the data they transform. A pipe that creates an HTTP request, stores the response and displays the output, is a stateful pipe. Stateful Pipes should be used cautiously.

Angular 2 provides `AsyncPipe`, which is stateful.

## AsyncPipe ##

AsyncPipe can receive a `Promise` or `Observable` as input and subscribe to the input automatically, eventually returning the emitted value(s). It is stateful because the pipe maintains a subscription to the input and its returned values depend on that subscription.

```javascript
import {Component} from '@angular/core';
import {Observable} from 'rxjs/Observable';
@Component({
  selector: 'product-price',
  template: `
    <p>Total price of product is {{fetchPrice | async | currency: "CAD": true: "1.2-2"}}</p>
    <p>Seconds: {{seconds | async}}</p>
  `
})
export class ProductPrice {
  count: number = 0;
  fetchPrice: Promise<number> = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => resolve(10), 500);
  });

  seconds: Observable<number> = new Observable(observer => {
    setInterval(() => { observer.next(this.count++); }, 1000);
  });
}

```

## Implementing Stateful Pipes ##

Pipes are stateless by default. We must declare a pipe to be stateful by setting the pure property of the `@Pipe` decorator to false. This setting tells Angularâ€™s change detection system to check the output of this pipe each cycle, whether its input has changed or not.

```javascript
import {Pipe, PipeTransform} from '@angular/core';

@Pipe({
  name: 'delay',
  pure: false
})
export class DelayPipe implements PipeTransform {

  private fetchedValue: number;
  private fetchPromise: Promise<number>;

  transform(value: number): number {
    if (!this.fetchPromise) {
      this.fetchPromise = new Promise<number>((resolve, reject) => {
        setTimeout(() => resolve(value * 1000), value * 500);
      });

      this.fetchPromise.then((val: number) => this.fetchedValue = val);
    }
    return this.fetchedValue;
  }
}

```
