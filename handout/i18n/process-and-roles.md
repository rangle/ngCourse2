## Process & Roles

In order for an application to successfully support multiple languages, multiple team members must closely dedicate their efforts to working together. Translators must be introduced to the team as they will be the ones translating the content and will need guidance on the intent and meaning of the words being used. Using Angular's i18n fascilities, the process would look like this:


 - Mark text messages in your templates for translation.

 - Use an angular i18n tool to extract the messages into an industry standard translation source file.

 - Provide the industry standard translation source files to a translator, who will translate the files and give them back to you.

 - Import the completed translation files using the Angular compiler
