# Part 13: Angular 2 and Redux ##

# What is Redux

Redux is an application state manager for JavaScript applications, and keeps with the core principals of flux-architecture by having a unidirectional data flow in your application.

How it differs from traditional Flux though, is that instead of multiple stores, you have one global application state. The state is calculated and returned in the reducer. The state management is held elsewhere.  The Redux pattern has become incredibly popular and has inspired the [ngrx implementation](https://github.com/ngrx "ngrx collection") which is exclusive to Angular2/RxJS.
