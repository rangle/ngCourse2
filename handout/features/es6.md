# ES6

JavaScript was created in 1995, but the language is still thriving today. There are subsets, supersets, current versions and the latest version, ES6, that brings a lot of new features.

Some of the highlights:

- Classes
- Arrow Functions
- Template Strings
- Inheritance
- Constants and Block Scoped Variables
- ...spread and ...rest
- Destructuring
- Modules
