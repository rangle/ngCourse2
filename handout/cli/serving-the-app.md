# Serving the App

The CLI provides the ability to serve the app with live reload. To serve an application, simply run the command `ng serve`. This will compile the app and copy all of the application-specific files to the *dist* folder before serving.

By default, `ng serve` serves the application locally on port 4200 ( http://localhost:4200 ) but this can be changed by using a command line argument: `ng serve --port=8080`.
