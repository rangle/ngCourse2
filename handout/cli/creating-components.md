# Creating Components

The CLI can scaffold Angular components through the `generate` command. To create a new component run:

`ng generate component [component-name]`

Executing the command creates a folder, [component-name], in the project's `src/app` path or the current path the command is executed in if it's a child folder of the project. The folder has the following:

- `[component-name].component.ts` the component class file
- `[component-name].component.css` for styling the component
- `[component-name].component.html` component html
- `[component-name].component.spec.ts` tests for the component
- `index.ts` which exports the component
