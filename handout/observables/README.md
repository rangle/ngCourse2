# Observables

An exciting new feature used with Angular is the `Observable`. This isn't an
Angular specific feature, but rather a proposed standard for managing
async data that will be included in the release of ES7. Observables open up a
continuous channel of communication in which multiple values of data can be
emitted over time. From this we get a pattern of dealing with data by using
array-like operations to parse, modify and maintain data. Angular uses
observables extensively - you'll see them in the HTTP service and the event
system.
