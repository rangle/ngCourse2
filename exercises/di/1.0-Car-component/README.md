# 1.0 - Car Component Dependencies

Create a root *Car* component that relies on three dependencies - *body.ts*, *engine.ts*, *tires.ts*. Give each of these dependency classes
one or two properties and give those properties some default values. Then, in the *Car* component, list those values. 

**Expected Results**:

There should be three lists, each one listing the properties of each dependency class. 

Example:

body
color = red
chrome = true

engine
v8 = false
horsepower = 2000

tires
size = 15
spinning = false
