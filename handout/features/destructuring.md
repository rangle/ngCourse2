# Destructuring

Destructuring is a way to quickly extract data out of an `{}` or `[]` without
having to write much code.

To [borrow from the MDN][mdnDest], destructuring can be used to turn the
following:
 
```js
let foo = ['one', 'two', 'three'];

let one   = foo[0];
let two   = foo[1];
let three = foo[2];
```

into

```js`
let foo = ['one', 'two', 'three'];
let [one, two, three] = foo;
console.log(one); // 'one'
```

This is pretty interesting, but at first it might be hard to see the use case.
ES6 also supports object destructuring, which might make uses more obvious:

```js
let myModule = {
  drawSquare: function drawSquare(length) { /* implementation */ },
  drawCircle: function drawCircle(radius) { /* implementation */ },
  drawText: function drawText(text) { /* implementation */ },
};

let {drawSquare, drawText} = myModule;

drawSquare(5);
drawText('hello');
```

Destructuring can also be used for passing objects into a function, allowing you to pull specific properties out of an object in a concise manner. It is also possible to assign default values to destructured arguments, which can be a useful pattern if passing in a configuration object.


```js
let jane = { firstName: 'Jane', lastName: 'Doe'};
let john = { firstName: 'John', lastName: 'Doe', middleName: 'Smith' }
function sayName({firstName, lastName, middleName = 'N/A'}) {
  console.log(`Hello ${firstName} ${middleName} ${lastName}`)  
}

sayName(jane) // -> Hello Jane N/A Doe
sayName(john) // -> Helo John Smith Doe
```

There are many more sophisticated things that can be done with destructuring,
and the [MDN][mdnDest] has some great examples, including nested object
destructuring and dynamic destructuring with  `for ... in`  operators".
