# Overview

Managing state is one the hardest challenges facing modern client
application development. The JavaScript community, in response, has
adopted certain patterns to help control the increasing complexity
brought upon by the presence of multiple data sources, asynchrony, web
workers and demanding UI requirements.

The Angular ecosystem, in both core development and community
contributions, provides support for many of these patterns.

# Objective

This webinar will outline best practices relating to structuring and
scaling rich Angular applications.

# Target Audience

Developers undertaking building large and complex Angular application.

# Assumed Audience Knowledge

Basic knowledge of TypeScript is assumed. Familiarity with Angular 1 or
another MV\* frameworks would be helpful but is not required.

# What You Will Learn:

* The benefits of unidirectional data flow
* The case for immutability by default
* Thinking through sending callbacks down vs emitting events up
* How to leverage observables to represent change
* Where MV\* patterns fit in
* How to build a robust services layer
