# Angular Universal

An interesting new feature introduced in Angular is the ability to render Angular views on the server and pass down the HTML to the client. Having the server render the first page of the application speeds up the initial load time considerably as the user is presented with the application almost instantly without needing to wait for angular to load and bootstrap.
