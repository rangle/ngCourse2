# The Handout

This folder contains the handout for the course, broken down into one Markdown file for each part of the course. You can access each part via Github, by
clicking on the file. Alternatively, you can generate a single HTML file by doing the following:

```bash
  cd handout
  npm install
  node build.js > handout.html
```

Please note that the handout is not meant to be used as a stand-alone text. In the course of the training the instructor will provide further explanation.
The main purpose of the handout is to help the students follow the course and to be able to revisit the material later.
