# Software Architecture Using Angular

[Angular][angular-site] has grown steadily more popular since its
release, and [a][book-hussain] [growing][book-frisbie]
[number][book-fain] [of][book-arora] [books][book-novak] are now
available to teach programmers how to use it.  But building an
application involves a lot more than just writing code: in order to be
performant and maintainable, the application must have some
over-arching architectural plan that ties its pieces together and
gives direction to future growth.

To help with this, [Rangle][rangle-site] has started to assemble a
guide to software architecture using Angular.  How should sets of
components be organized so that they can easily be tested and re-used?
How can Angular be combined with tools like Redux to simplify state
management in an asynchronous, event-driven world?  How can we design
today to make server-side rendering less painful to add tomorrow (and
should we be doing SSR at all)?  Sooner or later, every growing
application has to wrestle with these issues; our aim is to distill
expert knowledge so that people can make the right decisions early on.

The first chapter of this new guide, based on work by Daniel
Figueiredo and Renee Vrantsidis, is now available.  We would be
grateful for feedback on its content and format, and for suggestions
about other topics the community would like to see covered.  And if
you are interested in contributing, please [get in
touch][contact-address]: as always, we are smarter together than any
one of us is alone.
