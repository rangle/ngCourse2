# Forms

An application without user input is just a page. Capturing input from the user is the cornerstone of any application. In many cases, this means dealing with forms and all of their complexities.

Angular 2 is much more flexible than Angular 1.x for handling forms — we are no longer restricted to relying solely on `ngModel`. Instead, we are given degrees of simplicity and power, depending on the form's purpose.

* [Template-Driven Forms](template-driven_forms/) places most of the form handling logic within that form's template
* [Reactive Forms](reactive-forms/) places form handling logic within a component's class properties and provides interaction through observables
