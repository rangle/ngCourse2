Observables offer a flexible set of APIs for composing and transforming asynchronous streams. They provide a multitude of functions to create stream from many other types, and to manipulate and transform them. We've taken a look at how Angular 2 utilizes Observables to read user input, perform asynchronous data fetches, and set up custom emit/subscribe routines.
