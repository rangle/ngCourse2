# Immutable.js

[Immutable.js](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/) is a library that provides immutable generic collections.

## What is immutability?
**Immutability** is a design pattern where something can't be modified after being instantiated. If we want to change the value of that thing, we must recreate it with the new value instead. Some JavaScript types are immutable and some are mutable, meaning their value can change without having to recreate it. Let's explain this difference with some examples:

```typescript
let movie = {
  name: 'Star Wars',
  episode: 7
};

let myEp = movie.episode;

movie.episode = 8;

console.log(myEp); // outputs 7
```

As you can see in this case, although we changed the value of `movie.episode`, the value of `myEp` didn't change. That's because `movie.episode`'s type, `number`, is immutable.

```typescript
let movie1 = {
  name: 'Star Wars',
  episode: 7
};

let movie2 = movie1;

movie2.episode = 8;

console.log(movie1.episode); // outputs 8
```

In this case however, changing the value of episode on one object also changed the value of the other. That's because `movie1` and `movie2` are of the **Object** type, and Objects are mutable.

Of the JavaScript built-in types, these are immutable:
  - Boolean
  - Number
  - String
  - Symbol
  - Null
  - Undefined

These are mutable:
  - Object
  - Array
  - Function

String's an unusual case, since it can be iterated over using for...of and provides numeric indexers just like an array, but doing something like:

```typescript
let message = 'Hello world';
message[5] = '-';
console.log(message); // writes Hello world
```

**Note:** This will throw an error in strict mode and fail silently in non-strict mode.

## The case for immutability

One of the more difficult things to manage when structuring an application is managing its state. This is especially true when your application can execute code asynchronously. Let's say you execute some piece of code, but something causes it to wait (such as an http request or user input). After its completed, you notice the state its expecting changed because some other piece of code executed asynchronously and changed its value.

Dealing with that kind of behaviour on a small scale might be manageable, but this can show up all over an application and can be a real headache as the application gets bigger with more interactions and more complex logic.

Immutability attempts to solve this by making sure that any object that's been referenced in one part of the code can't all of a sudden be changed by another part of the code unless they have the ability to rebind it directly.

## JavaScript solutions

Some new features have been added in ES6 that allow for easier implementation of immutable data patterns.

### Object.assign

`Object.assign` lets us merge one object's properties into another one, replacing values of properties with matching names. We can use this to copy an object's values without altering the existing one.

```typescript
let movie1 = {
  name: 'Star Wars',
  episode: 7
};

let movie2 = Object.assign({}, movie1);

movie2.episode = 8;

console.log(movie1.episode); // writes 7
console.log(movie2.episode); // writes 8
```

As you can see, although we have some way of copying an object, we haven't made it immutable, since we were able to set the episode's property to 8. Also, how do we modify the episode property in this case? We do that through the assign call:

```typescript
let movie1 = {
  name: 'Star Wars',
  episode: 7
};

let movie2 = Object.assign({}, movie1, { episode: 8 });

console.log(movie1.episode); // writes 7
console.log(movie2.episode); // writes 8
```

### Object.freeze

`Object.freeze` allows us to disable object mutation.

```typescript
let movie1 = {
  name: 'Star Wars',
  episode: 7
};

let movie2 = Object.freeze(Object.assign({}, movie1));

movie2.episode = 8; // fails silently in non-strict mode,
                    // throws error in strict mode

console.log(movie1.episode); // writes 7
console.log(movie2.episode); // writes 7
```

One problem with this pattern however, is how much more verbose our code is and how difficult it is to read and understand what's actually going on with our data with all of the boilerplate calls to `Object.freeze` and `Object.assign`. We need some more sensible interface to create and interact with immutable data, and that's where Immutable.js fits in.

**Note:** `Object.freeze` is also very slow and should not be done with large arrays.


## Immutable.js basics

To solve our mutability problem, Immutable.js needs to provide immutable versions of the two core mutable types, **Object** and **Array**.

### Immutable.Map
`Map` is the immutable version of JavaScript's object structure. Due to JavaScript objects having the concise object literal syntax, it's often used as a key-value store with `key` being type `string`. This pattern closely follows the map data structure. Let's revisit the previous example, but use `Immutable.Map` instead.

```typescript
import * as Immutable from 'immutable';

let movie1 = Immutable.Map<string, any>({
  name: 'Star Wars',
  episode: 7
});

let movie2 = movie1;

movie2 = movie2.set('episode', 8);

console.log(movie1.get('episode')); // writes 7
console.log(movie2.get('episode')); // writes 8
```

Instead of binding the object literal directly to `movie1`, we pass it as an argument to `Immutable.Map`. This changes how we interact with movie1's properties.

To _get_ the value of a property, we call the `get` method, passing the property name we want, like how we'd use an object's string indexer.

To _set_ the value of a property, we call the `set` method, passing the property name and the new value. Note that it *won't* mutate the existing Map object. It returns a new object with the updated property so we need to rebind the `movie2` variable to the new object.


#### Map.merge

Sometimes we want to update multiple properties. We can do this using the `merge` method.

```typescript
let baseButton = Immutable.Map<string, any>({
  text: 'Click me!',
  state: 'inactive',
  width: 200,
  height: 30
});

let submitButton = baseButton.merge({
  text: 'Submit',
  state: 'active'
});

console.log(submitButton);
// writes { text: 'Submit', state: 'active', width: 200, height: 30 }
```


### Nested Objects

`Immutable.Map` wraps objects shallowly, meaning if you have an object with properties bound to mutable types then those properties can be mutated.

```typescript
let movie = Immutable.Map({
	name: 'Star Wars',
	episode: 7,
	actors: [
		{ name: 'Daisy Ridley', character: 'Rey'},
		{ name: 'Harrison Ford', character: 'Han Solo' }
	],
	mpaa: {
		rating: 'PG-13',
		reason: 'sci-fi action violence'
	}
});

movie.get('actors').pop();
movie.get('mpaa').rating = 'PG';

console.log(movie.toObject());

/* writes
{ name: 'Star Wars',
  episode: 7,
  actors: [ { name: 'Daisy Ridley', character: 'Rey' } ],
  mpaa: { rating: 'PG', reason: 'sci-fi action violence' } }
  */
```

To avoid this issue, use `Immutable.fromJS` instead.

```typescript
let movie = Immutable.fromJS({
	name: 'Star Wars',
	episode: 7,
	actors: [
		{ name: 'Daisy Ridley', character: 'Rey'},
		{ name: 'Harrison Ford', character: 'Han Solo' }
	],
	mpaa: {
		rating: 'PG-13',
		reason: 'sci-fi action violence'
	}
});

movie.get('actors').pop();
movie.get('mpaa').rating = 'PG';

console.log(movie.toObject());

/* writes
{ name: 'Star Wars',
  episode: 7,
  actors: List [ Map { "name": "Daisy Ridley", "character": "Rey" }, Map { "name": "Harrison Ford", "character": "Han Solo" } ],
  mpaa: Map { "rating": "PG-13", "reason": "sci-fi action violence" } }
*/
```

So let's say you want to modify `movie.mpaa.rating`, you might think of doing something like this: `movie = movie.get('mpaa').set('rating', 'PG')`. However, `set` will always return the calling Map instance which in this case returns the Map bound to the `mpaa` key rather than the movie you wanted. We need to use the `setIn` method to update nested properties.

```typescript
let movie = Immutable.fromJS({
	name: 'Star Wars',
	episode: 7,
	actors: [
		{ name: 'Daisy Ridley', character: 'Rey'},
		{ name: 'Harrison Ford', character: 'Han Solo' }
	],
	mpaa: {
		rating: 'PG-13',
		reason: 'sci-fi action violence'
	}
});

movie = movie
  .update('actors', actors => actors.pop())
  .setIn(['mpaa', 'rating'], 'PG');

console.log(movie.toObject());

/* writes
{ name: 'Star Wars',
  episode: 7,
  actors: List [ Map { "name": "Daisy Ridley", "character": "Rey" } ],
  mpaa: Map { "rating": "PG", "reason": "sci-fi action violence" } }
*/
```

We also added in a call to `Map.update` which, unlike set, accepts a function as the second argument instead of a value. This function accepts the existing value at that key and must return the new value of that key.

#### Deleting keys

Keys can be deleted from maps using the `Map.delete` and `Map.deleteIn` methods.

```typescript
let movie = Immutable.fromJS({
	name: 'Star Wars',
	episode: 7,
	actors: [
		{ name: 'Daisy Ridley', character: 'Rey'},
		{ name: 'Harrison Ford', character: 'Han Solo' }
	],
	mpaa: {
		rating: 'PG-13',
		reason: 'sci-fi action violence'
	}
});

movie = movie.delete('mpaa');

console.log(movie.toObject());

/* writes
{ name: 'Star Wars',
  episode: 7,
  actors: List [ Map { "name": "Daisy Ridley", "character": "Rey" }, Map { "name": "Harrison Ford", "character": "Han Solo" } ] }
*/
```

#### Maps are iterable

Maps in Immutable.js are _iterable_, meaning that you can `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, etc. each key-value pair in the map.

```typescript
let features = Immutable.Map<string, boolean>({
	'send-links': true,
	'send-files': true,
	'local-storage': true,
	'mirror-notifications': false,
	'api-access': false
});

let myFeatures = features.reduce((providedFeatures, provided, feature) => {
	if(provided)
		providedFeatures.push(feature);

  return providedFeatures;
}, []);

console.log(myFeatures); // [ 'send-links', 'send-files', 'local-storage' ]
```

```typescript
const mapMap = Immutable.Map({ a: 0, b: 1, c: 2 });
mapMap.map(i => i * 30);

const mapFilter = Immutable.Map({ a: 0, b: 1, c: 2 });

mapFilter.filter(i => i % 2);

const mapReduce = Immutable.Map({ a: 10, b: 20, c: 30 });

mapReduce.reduce((acc, i) => acc + i, 0);
```

### Immutable.List

`List` is the immutable version of JavaScript's array structure.

```typescript
let movies = Immutable.fromJS([ // again use fromJS for deep immutability
  {
    name: 'The Fellowship of the Ring',
    released: 2001,
    rating: 8.8
  },
  {
    name: 'The Two Towers',
    released: 2002,
    rating: 8.7
  }
]);

movies = movies.push(Immutable.Map({
    name: 'The Return of the King',
    released: 2003
}));

movies = movies.update(2, movie => movie.set('rating', 8.9)); // 0 based

movies = movies.zipWith(
  (movie, seriesNumber) => movie.set('episode', seriesNumber),
  Immutable.Range(1, movies.size + 1) // size property instead of length
);

console.log(movies);
/* writes
List [
  Map { "name": "The Fellowship of the Ring", "released": 2001, "rating": 8.8, "episode": 1 },
  Map { "name": "The Two Towers", "released": 2002, "rating": 8.7, "episode": 2 },
  Map { "name": "The Return of the King", "released": 2003, "rating": 8.9, "episode": 3 } ]
  */
```

Here we use the `Immutable.fromJS` call again since we have objects stored in the array. We call `push` to add items to the list, just like we would call it on an array but since we're creating a new copy we need to rebind the variable. We have the same `set` and `update` calls when we want to update items at specific indexes. We also have access to array functions like `map`, `reduce` with support for extras like the one we're using here, `zipWith`.

### Performance

Due to having to allocate memory and having to copy the data structure whenever any change is made, this can potentially lead to a large number of extra operations having to be performed depending on what type of changes are made and how many of them. To demonstrate the difference, here is a [test run](http://jsperf.com/immutable-js-data-structure-perf1/3). Doing memory allocation and copy on large strings can be expensive even on a shallow object.


### Persistent and transient data structures

Immutable data structures are also sometimes referred to as **persistent data structures**, since its values persist for its lifetime. Immutable.js provides the option for **transient data structures**, which is a mutable version of a persistent data structure during a transformation stage and returning a new immutable version upon completion. This is one approach to solving the performance issues we encountered earlier. Let's revisit the immutable case outlined in the peformance example, but using a transient data structure this time:

```typescript
import * as Immutable from 'immutable';

let list = Immutable.List();

list = list.withMutations(mutableList => {
  let val = "";

  return Immutable.Range(0, 1000000)
    .forEach(() => {
      val += "concatenation";
      mutableList.push(val);
  });
});

console.log(list.size); // writes 1000000
list.push('');
console.log(list.size); // writes 1000000
```

As we can see in [this performance test](http://jsperf.com/immutable-js-data-structure-perf2/2), the transient list builder was still a lot slower than the fully mutable version, but much faster than the fully immutable version. Also, if you pass the mutable array to `Immutable.List` or `Immutable.fromJS`, you'll find the transient version closes the performance gap. The test also shows how slow `Object.freeze` can be compared to the other 3.
