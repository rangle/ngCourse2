# Creating a Brand New App

Use the `ng new [app-name]` command to create a new app. This will generate a basic app in the folder of the app name provided. The app has all of the features available to work with the CLI commands. Creating an app may take a few minutes to complete since npm will need to install all of the dependencies. The directory is automatically set up as a new **git** repository as well. If git is not your version control of choice, simply remove the *.git* folder and *.gitignore* file.

# File and Folder Setup

The generated app folder will look like this:

![App folder](../images/cli-folder-setup.png)

Application configuration is stored in different places, some located in the *config* folder, such as test configuration, and some being stored in the project root such as linting information and build information. The CLI stores application specific files in the *src* folder and Angular 2 specific code in the *src/app* folder.  Files and folders generated by the CLI will follow the [official style guide.](https://angular.io/styleguide)

*Warning: The CLI relies on some of the settings defined in the configuration files to be able to execute the commands. Take care when modifying them, particularly the package.json file.*

The CLI has installed everything a basic Angular 2 application needs to run properly. To make sure everything has run and installed correctly we can run the server.
