# Forms
An application without user input is just a page. Capturing input from the user is the cornerstone of any application. In many cases, this means dealing with forms and all of their complexities.

Angular 2 is much more flexible than Angular 1.x for handling forms â€” we are no longer restricted to relying solely on `ngModel`. Instead, we are given degrees of simplicity and power, depending on the form's purpose.

- [Template-Driven Forms](template-driven/template-driven_forms.md) places most of the form handling logic within that form's template
- [Reactive Forms](reactive-forms/reactive-forms.md) places form handling logic within a component's class properties and provides interaction through observables
