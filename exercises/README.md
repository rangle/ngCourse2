Welcome to the Angular 2 Training Exercises Section.

Under this folder, you will find a number of stand-alone exercises that will provide you with the opportunity to try out the concepts discussed in each section of the training course.

Each exercise will contain a skeleton for an application, with instructions on the expected results. There is also an accompanying solution folder showing a potential solution to the problem.

These exercises do not require a build step to run, and you can use a light-weight HTTP server such as the node 'http-server' to run an exercise. For example:

```
npm install -g live-server
cd ... (path to exercise)
live-server .
```

and open your browser at http://127.0.0.1:8080/
