# Command-line JavaScript: [Node.JS](http://nodejs.org)

NodeJS is an environment that lets you write JavaScript programs that live outside the browser.  It provides:

* the V8 JavaScript interpreter
* modules for doing OS tasks like file I/O, HTTP, etc.

While NodeJS was initially intended for writing server code in JavaScript, today it is widely used by JavaScript tools, which makes it relevant to front-end developers too. A lot of the tools you'll be using in this code leverage NodeJS.
