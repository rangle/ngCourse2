Unit testing Redux is a very straightforward process. There are two primary units:

* _Actions_ trigger changes in a Redux system. There are two broad categories of actions: synchronous (which are quite simple to test) and asynchronous (which are slightly more involved). 

The examples below should provide you with a strong foundation for testing Redux applications.
