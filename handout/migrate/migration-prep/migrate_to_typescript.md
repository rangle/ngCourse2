# Migrating to TypeScript

TypeScript is a superset of ES6 and, as its name suggests, uses a type system.
This can have an enormous impact on developer tools, providing richer
auto-complete and static analysis.

Angular was built using TypeScript, and supports decorators which provide meta
information to Angular.  While it is possible to use Angular without these 
features, the syntax feels more "natural" with TypeScript's decorators.
