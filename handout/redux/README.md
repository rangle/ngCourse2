# Redux

## What is Redux?

Redux is an application state manager for JavaScript applications, and keeps
with the core principles of the Flux-architecture by having a unidirectional
data flow in your application.

Where Flux applications traditionally have multiple stores, Redux applications
have only one global, read-only application state. This state is calculated by
'reducing' over a collection or stream of actions that update it in controlled
ways.

The Redux pattern has become very popular and has inspired
[Ngrx](https://github.com/ngrx "ngrx collection") which is exclusive to
Angular2/RxJS.

In this course we discuss a more traditional Redux pattern using the
[Ng2-Redux](https://github.com/wbuchwalter/ng2-redux) bindings library.
