# Project Setup

Proper tooling and setup is good for any project, but it's especially important for Angular due to all of the pieces that are involved. We've decided to use [webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack), a powerful tool that attempts to handle our complex integrations. Due to the number of parts of our project that webpack touches, it's important to go over the configuration to get a good understanding of what gets generated client-side.
