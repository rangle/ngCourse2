# Workshop 2 - API And Auth

Pull down the `workshop-2` branch.

```shell
$ git checkout -b workshop-2 origin/workshop-2
```

All of the tasks from the previous workshop will be completed. You will have a TodoMVC app that is working, however all of the tasks are stored in memory and a login flow has not yet been set up.

In this workshop, we will need to:

- Create the Tasks service for consuming the API
- Create an Authentication for login
- Set up the Login flow and routes
- Update our Task Actions to use the Task service
- Update our Task Edit and Task Add containers to navigate after the action has been completed.
