# Using Auxiliary Routes

Angular supports the concept of auxiliary routes, which allow you to set up and navigate multiple independent routes in a single app. Each component has one primary route and zero or more auxiliary outlets. Auxiliary outlets must have unique name within a component.

To define the auxiliary route we must first add a named router outlet where contents for the auxiliary route are to be rendered.

Here's an example:

```javascript
import {Component} from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app',
  template: `
    <nav>
      <a [routerLink]="['/component-one']">Component One</a>
      <a [routerLink]="['/component-two']">Component Two</a>
      <a [routerLink]="[{ outlets: { 'sidebar': ['component-aux'] } }]">Component Aux</a>
    </nav>

    <div style="color: green; margin-top: 1rem;">Outlet:</div>
    <div style="border: 2px solid green; padding: 1rem;">
      <router-outlet></router-outlet>
    </div>

    <div style="color: green; margin-top: 1rem;">Sidebar Outlet:</div>
    <div style="border: 2px solid blue; padding: 1rem;">
      <router-outlet name="sidebar"></router-outlet>
    </div>
  `
})
export class AppComponent {

}
```

Next we must define the link to the auxiliary route for the application to navigate and render the contents.

```html
<a [routerLink]="[{ outlets: { 'sidebar': ['component-aux'] } }]">
  Component Aux
</a>
```

Each auxiliary route is an independent route which can have:

* its own child routes
* its own auxiliary routes
* its own route-params
* its own history stack
