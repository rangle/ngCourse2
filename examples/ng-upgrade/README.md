# ng-upgrade example

This example is a stand alone Angular 1.x / Angular 2 hybrid application and
requires its own installation.

From the `ng-upgrade` directory run `npm install` _once_ to fetch all the
application's dependencies.  Then from within the `ng-upgrade` folder run
`npm start` to launch the application.
