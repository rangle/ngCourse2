# Attribute Directives

Attribute directives are a way of changing the appearance or behavior of a component. Ideally, a directive should work in a way that is component agnostic and not bound to implementation details.

For example, Angular 2 has built-in attribute directives such as `ngClass` and `ngStyle` that work on any component or element.
